This is a project meant to refresh and hone in my skills in React. The front-end, built in React, was coded following Tech with Tim and I do not claim credit for it. I am augmenting the project by adding a Spring back-end to securely handle API calls to the movie database. This project is purely education to enhance my own skills.
