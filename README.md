This is a project meant to refresh and hone in my skills in React. The front-end, built in React, was coded following Tech with Tim and I do not claim credit for it. I am augmenting the project by adding a Spring back-end to securely handle API calls to the movie database. This project is purely education to enhance my own skills.

Backend API Endpoints

`GET popular movies`

Returns popular movies from The Movie Database as a list of Movie Response DTOs. This API endpoint when called internally makes a call to The Movie Database's API
